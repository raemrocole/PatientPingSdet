This code is not testable or maintainable in it's current state, your task is to refactor it.
    - Add comments to describe what's happening.
    - Create test cases to be sure the functionality is correct.
    - Fix bugs found by tests.

Expected functionality:
    - Load the CSV of books correctly and in a robust manner.
    - Print the number of english books.
    - Print the author with the most books. The authors column often has more than one author, be sure to account for that.
    - Print the author of the book with the highest average star rating. Exclude any books from consideration that
      have fewer than 25 total ratings.
    - Print the author of the book with the highest ratio of text reviews to star reviews on their books and what the ratio is.
    - Print the author with the highest average star rating across all of their books. (This isn't implemented yet. Please add it.)
